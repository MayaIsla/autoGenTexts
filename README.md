# textAuto

Autogenerated phone number that sends a mass loop of texts from a JSON file. Connects to Wikipedia API and creates randomly generated articles that are complemented from the JSON form. 

This is a great example of using loops, imported libraries, and amazing API's from Wikipedia! More practice for the requests package for Python.
